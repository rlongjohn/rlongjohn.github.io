    "text": "I am a Statistics Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) advised by Dr. Padhraic Smyth. I’m interested in addressing problems at the intersection of statistics and AI/ML, with a focus on improving how they’re applied in practical, real-world settings. Some of my key areas of interest include testing and evaluation practices, ethics and governance, and uncertainty quantification. I am also passionate about data-centric issues in AI/ML and served as a data curator and librarian for the UCI Machine Learning Repository for much of my time at UCI.\nI received my Master’s degree in Statistics from UCI in 2021, and my Bachelor’s degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics, with a specialization in Computer Programming, from the University of Southern California in 2019."

For this project, we are working on improving the repository to better support AI/ML research, e.g., by compiling more comprehensive and structured metadata for datasets, using text analysis to track and link dataset citations in the literature, and providing automatically-generated baseline evaluations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLos Alamos National Laboratory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the summer of 2023, I worked as a graduate student researcher with mentors Dr. Emily Casleton and Dr. Giri Gopalan in the Statistical Sciences group at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
