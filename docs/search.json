I am broadly interested in the statistical aspects of AI/ML testing and evaluation, particularly regarding ethics, safety, fairness, and responsibility and in social science, law, and policy applications. I am also passionate about data curation, provenance, and documentation issues in ML and serve as a curator and librarian for the UCI Machine Learning Repository.\nI received my Master’s degree in Statistics from UCI in 2021, and my Bachelor’s degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics, with a specialization in Computer Programming, from the University of Southern California in 2019."

For this project, we are working on improving the repository to better support AI/ML research, e.g., by compiling more comprehensive and structured metadata for datasets, using text analysis to track and link dataset citations in the literature, and providing automatically-generated baseline evaluations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLos Alamos National Laboratory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the summer of 2023, I worked as a graduate student researcher with mentors Dr. Emily Casleton and Dr. Giri Gopalan in the Statistical Sciences group at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
