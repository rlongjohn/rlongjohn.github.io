For this project, we are working on improving the repository to better support AI/ML research, e.g., by compiling more comprehensive and structured metadata for datasets, using text analysis to track and link dataset citations in the literature, and providing automatically-generated baseline evaluations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLos Alamos National Laboratory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the summer of 2023, I worked as a graduate student researcher with mentors Dr. Emily Casleton and Dr. Giri Gopalan in the Statistical Sciences group at Los Alamos National Laboratory. For this project, we investigated statistical approaches for the testing and evaluation of pre-trained models (such), focusing in particular on uncertainty quantification techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNIST Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the CSAFE consortium, we are developing statistical methodologies for supporting forensics in the analysis of behavioral event data from digital devices.
