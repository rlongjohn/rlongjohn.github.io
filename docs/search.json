My research interests include forensic statistics, uncertainty quantification, and algorithmic evaluation, explainability, and fairness in machine learning. I am also interested in supporting efforts in data curation and reproducible research and serve as a curator and librarian for the UCI Machine Learning Repository.\nIn the summer of 2023, I was an intern for the Statistical Sciences group at Los Alamos National Laboratory advised by Dr. Emily Casleton and Dr. Giri Gopalan. I received my Master’s degree in Statistics from UCI in 2021, and my Bachelor’s degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics, with a specialization in Computer Programming, from the University of Southern California in 2019."

    "text": "NIST Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the CSAFE consortium, we are developing statistical methodologies for supporting forensics in the analysis of behavioral event data from digital devices. We are investigating probabilistic models that address identity-related forensics questions, such as whether two sets of texts were generated by the same individual or by two different individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLos Alamos National Laboratory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am working as a graduate student researcher in the Statistical Sciences group at Los Alamos National Laboratory; I am advised in this work by Dr. Emily Casleton and Dr. Giri Gopalan. We are investigating statistical approaches for the testing and evaluation of foundation models, focusing in particular on uncertainty quantification techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCI Machine Learning Repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI serve as a curator and librarian for the UCI Machine Learning Repository team, which is co-advised by Dr. Sameer Singh, Dr. Padhraic Smyth, and Dr. Phillip Papadopoulos. For this project, we are working on improving the repository to better support methodological research, e.g., by compiling more comprehensive and structured metadata for datasets, using text analysis to track and link dataset citations in the literature, and providing automatically-generated baseline evaluations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCI COVID Awareness Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UCI COVID Awareness Group constructed a dashboard for visualizing the trends of hospitalizations, ICU patients, cases, and deaths of COVID-19 in California. The data used to construct the dashboard comes from the California Open Data Portal and the Orange County Health Agency.\nPress: UCI researchers launch first-of-its-kind coronavirus statistics portal."
